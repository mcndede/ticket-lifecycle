To simulate a help desk environment, I created sample tickets. Starting with a new ticket under “Report a Problem” for the user Karen, I entered a summary stating that the online banking system was down. The description noted that employees reported users could not access the portal consistently, and those who could were unable to log in. Once the details were entered, I submitted the ticket to begin the workflow.

Next, I logged in as “John,” a help desk professional, to review the ticket created by Karen. Within the ticket details, I was able to view the status, priority, SLA, department, assigned staff, and help desk topic. Before resolving the issue, I updated the missing fields and properly assigned the ticket to a help desk professional, demonstrating how tickets are routed and prepared for resolution.</p>

Finally, I began by documenting an initial observation on the ticket board, noting that the issue might be connected to recent updates. I then tested this theory, confirmed the root cause, and recorded the findings on the ticket. After identifying that the update caused the outage, I documented the rollback, notified the vendor, and confirmed that online banking was restored. Finally, I closed the ticket as resolved, completing the full lifecycle of my first simulated support case.
